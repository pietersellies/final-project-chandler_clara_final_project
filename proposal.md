The unicellular, green alga _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ has been used as a model species for researches due to its haploid state, remarkably quick reproduction, and similarity in photosystem structure to land plants. With global surface temperatures warming and increased frequency and intensity of drought due to climate change, food supply for the global future is of concern. Understanding the genes, proteins, and biochemical pathways involved with light quenching is imperative to our ability to survive as climate change alters our ecosystem faster than evolution can follow. 

The Niyogi lab in the Plant and Microbial Biology Department of the University of California, Berkeley has targeted the PSBS gene with CRISPR-CPF1 (a cousin protein of CAS-9) to begin to unlock the secrets of non-photochemical quenching, or dissipation of excess energy recieved by light. This CRISPR transformation, however, has generated 400 potential mutants. These mutants were screened using a video-imager that measured non-photochemical quenching via fluorescence of chlorophyll as a function of light exposure. In the first part of this project we intend to tidy this data, calculate average values, and visualize it as a line graph. In the second section, we will attempt to recreate the standard NPQ curve by comparing an averaged set of our control values to published findings. The third part of the project is determining if any values are statistically significant, assuming that the mutants were not successfully transformed. 

The data for this project will be csv files obtained by video imager measurements made by Chandler Sutherland in conjunction with the Niyogi lab.
